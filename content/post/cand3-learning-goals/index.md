My learning goals during my 2021-2022 [Consortium on Analytics for Data-Driven Decision-Making (CAnD3)](https://www.mcgill.ca/cand3/) Fellowship are:

1. To develop my knowledge of interdisciplinary research in population aging
2. To improve my understanding of how research findings are applied and effectively communicated outside of academic settings
3. To gain experience working with a health industry partner through an internship
4. To hone my skills in data visualization (in R, GitHub, and Python)
