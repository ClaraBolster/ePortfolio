I am a PhD candidate in Epidemiology at McGill University, in the School of Population and Global Health. My research broadly seeks to understand patterns of social disparities in health and wellbeing, and how these inequalities are impacted by health and social policies. My doctoral research examines social inequalities in aging in place in Quebec and explores the role of access to primary healthcare and social support in shaping these inequalities. I use methods for quantitative intersectional analyses and causal inference with observational data and apply theoretical principles of intersectionality.

Prior to beginning my doctoral training, I worked at the Public Health Agency of Canada on research products focused on developing a conceptual framework of structural determinants of stigma across health and social conditions and identifying barriers and facilitators to accessing HIV testing in Canada. I am currently collaborating with a regional healthcare industry partner in Ontario (SE Health) to evaluate case-mix groupings for home care delivery models for older adults transitioning out of acute care.
